## What is this?

This is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** designed specifically for AI agents and LLM applications. It acts as a bridge between artificial intelligence systems and the comprehensive OpenStreetMap tagging knowledge base provided by the official `@openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema` library.

**Current Status**: Production-ready MCP server, actively maintained and continuously improved. The service is deployed and accessible at [https://mcp.gander.tools/osm-tagging/](https://mcp.gander.tools/osm-tagging/).

**We welcome your feedback!** Have ideas for improvements? Found a bug? Want to discuss features? Please open an [issue](https://github.com/gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp/discussions).

## What this is NOT

⚠️ **Important clarifications:**

- **Not a standalone application**: This server requires integration with AI systems (like Claude Code or Claude Desktop) to be useful. It has no user interface or web frontend.
- **Not for direct human use**: Without an AI agent as an intermediary, this tool provides no value to end users. It's designed exclusively for programmatic access by LLM applications.
- **Not a public API for general use**: The deployed service at mcp.gander.tools is intended for integration with AI agents, not for direct HTTP requests or high-volume automated queries. Please do not attempt to abuse the service with DDoS attacks or excessive traffic.

If you're looking for a user-facing OSM tagging tool, consider [iD editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) or [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) instead.

## Features

**7 MCP Tools** organized into 3 categories:

- **Tag Query** (2 tools): Query tag values and search tags
- **Preset Discovery** (2 tools): Search and explore OSM presets with detailed configurations
- **Validation** (3 tools): Validate tags, check for deprecated tags, suggest improvements

📖 **Full tool reference**: [docs/api/](./docs/api/README.md)

## Installation

### Using npx (Recommended)

```bash
# No installation needed - run directly
npx @gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Run with stdio transport
docker run -i ghcr.io/gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp:latest
```

📖 **More options**: [docs/user/installation.md](./docs/user/installation.md) (source installation, verification, troubleshooting)

## Quick Start

### With Claude Code CLI

```bash
# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add @gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp

# Use in conversations
# Ask Claude: "What OSM tags are available for restaurants?"
# Ask Claude: "Validate these tags: amenity=parking, capacity=50"
```

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osm-tagging-schema": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- [Usage Guide](./docs/user/usage.md) - Tool examples and workflows
- [API Reference](./docs/api/README.md) - Complete tool documentation
- [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment/deployment.md) - Production HTTP/Docker deployment

### Testing with MCP Inspector

Test and debug the server using the official [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
# Test published package (quickest)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp

# Test Docker image
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/gander-tools/osm-tagging-schema-mcp
```

The Inspector provides an interactive web UI to test all tools, inspect responses, and debug issues.

📖 **Complete inspection guide**: [docs/development/inspection.md](./docs/development/inspection.md) (includes HTTP transport testing)

## Development

Built with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Property-Based Fuzzing**:
- Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration) with 100% pass rate
- Property-based fuzz tests with fast-check for edge case discovery
- Continuous fuzzing in CI/CD (weekly schedule + on every push/PR)

```bash
npm install      # Install dependencies
npm test         # Run all tests
npm run test:fuzz # Run fuzz tests
npm run build    # Build for production
```
