      label: 📝 Feature Description
      description: A clear and detailed description of the feature you'd like to see
      placeholder: |
        Example: Add a new tool called "get_tag_relationships" that returns which tags
        commonly appear together with a given tag, based on the preset configurations.

      label: 🎯 Use Case
      description: Describe the problem this feature would solve or the workflow it would improve
      placeholder: |
        Example: When mapping a new POI, I want to know which additional tags are typically
        used together (e.g., when adding amenity=restaurant, I should be prompted for
        cuisine, opening_hours, wheelchair, etc.). This would help ensure complete and
        consistent tagging.

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed-solution
    attributes:
      label: 💡 Proposed Solution
      description: Describe how you envision this feature working
      placeholder: |
        Example: The tool would accept a tag key-value pair and return:
        - Related tags from the same preset
        - Common combinations from field dependencies
        - Suggested tags based on geometry type
        - Priority level (required/recommended/optional)

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: alternatives
    attributes:
      label: 🔄 Alternatives Considered
      description: Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Currently I can use get_preset_details and manually filter the fields,
        but this requires multiple API calls and client-side processing.

      required: false

            "value": "restaurant"
          }
        }

        - This would require indexing preset fields at startup
