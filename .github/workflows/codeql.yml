# DISABLED: This workflow is currently disabled due to conflict with default CodeQL setup
#
# TO ENABLE THIS WORKFLOW:
# 1. Go to: Settings → Code security and analysis → CodeQL analysis
# 2. Click "Disable" on the default setup
# 3. Uncomment the triggers below (push, pull_request, schedule)
# 4. This advanced workflow will then activate with security-extended queries
#
# WHY ADVANCED WORKFLOW?
# - More comprehensive security checks (security-extended query suite)
# - Custom configuration options
# - Control over when scans run
#
# Current state: Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch)
