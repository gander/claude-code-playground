# Production Dockerfile using pre-built dist/ artifact from NPM publish
# This Dockerfile is used for release builds (version tags) where dist/ comes from
# the NPM publish workflow artifact, ensuring the Docker image contains the exact
# same code that was published to NPM with SLSA attestations.
#
# For development builds (PRs, master branch), use the standard Dockerfile which
# includes multi-stage build with TypeScript compilation.

# Pinned to manifest list digest for security and multi-platform compatibility
# This digest references a manifest list supporting: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6, linux/s390x
# Docker BuildKit automatically uses the target platform for multi-arch builds
# To update: curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/node/tags/24-alpine | jq -r '.digest'
